Told the manager that I  was disappointed. He told me that this cheese bites pizza that was overcooked so badly that the cheese had completely melted and burned out of the bites that were rock hard, was ""perfect"". That ""nothing was wrong with the pizza"" ""if he made another it would look exactly the same"" ""you must not like cheese bites pizza because this is what it's supposed to look like"" ""you ate almost half off it and you touched the whole pizza"" (a note on that last one: my family tried to choke it down before I took it back because it was awful. We ate 1 slice, 1 bite, and .5 slice)... as well as many other comments.
I had gone back to the store to have a satisfactory meal prepared, but given the manager's 'standard' of quality and attitude, I asked for a refund. To which he responded ""That's what I figured you wanted all along"", as if I would go through all this nonsense to somehow ""get away"" with one terrible slice of pizza. I expect better from this company, but if this manager is a representative of Pizza Hut, then there is definitely a customer service problem that people should be aware of.",2018

The food is always what you would expect too. Well made, a few really good items (bang bang, the big pretzel when it is cooked right)

The nice thing is the 100+beers on tap and TVs all over.

The few items to know... the Pot Pie is massive...looking, it is about 10 inches wide but shallow. Which is a good thing because the crust rocks and the chicken is real.

The beer flights are nice ideas, but they are not labeled so you have to make a guess on what is what...

The wings were the best I've had in years! Bone in,, lightly battered were HUGE. Mild sauce was perfect, served with celery & carrots. Order of 10, I ate 3 they were so big & served right out of the fryer.
Steak fries were Marcy's suggestion...delish!! The boneless were just as tasty, as was the crispy salad...a mix of iceberg & spring mix, topped with all fresh veggies.
The restaurant was SPOTLESS, floors didn't have one crumb on them. And I looked! Manager on Duty visited every table. What a great dining experience.
Highly Recommend, family, friends & couples.",2021

I think the bar with what looked like 8 or so drafts created a hang out like atmosphere. I was intrigued.

I ordered a bowl and a soft taco to see how things turn out.  The bowl was very tasty as was the soft taco.  I kinda liked them as an order.  However, there was just a little too much grease in the bowl.  My wifes taco was soaked in it as you can see from the pictures.

Also, things were not getting cleaned up very quickly leaving an unsightly mess at the trash cans.

So management, either upgrade your meat to eliminate the grease factor (maybe it adds to the flavor but soaking is not cool) or strain it off somehow and have someone pay attention to the trash, particularly when it is busy.  It cost you a star.",2018

Previous review: My wife had the meatloaf dinner and I had the all you could eat fish. The food was as excellent as always. The service was not as good as usual. Their female servers are always wonderful but unfortunately we got a guy server who clearly is not cut out for the drive industry. He never once asked how our meals were, and in spite of being reminded twice that my wife's roll had not yet been provided, he never did bring it. And he never said anything about our empty glasses of water, so I had to stop him while he was attending to others. And when I did he brought me a glass of water but left my wife's empty one sit there. We'll be back because this is the only problem we've ever had and we love Our Place Dunedin, but we will request a different server if we get stuck with him.",2021

The flavors were awesome! All the ingredients used in the dishes were fresh and all of the food purchased was definitely homemade. The drinks were even good.

The restaurant had a lot of history within it's walls with Cuban memorabilia everywhere. It felt great sitting there amongst some history.  The drinks were good and the Red Bull Mojito was something new for me but it was a great risk that ended pleasant. My friends said they liked their drinks and one of them who has a palate for alcohol said the Cubra Libre was one of the best he has had ever.

The Bad:
I had the Cuban Sampler which was a mix of different meats and it was actually good. I wish their were more beans on my plate because they were DELICIOUS!! Out of the three meets I had the chicken was the best and that gravy was good but again, those beans were DELICIOUS and I felt shortchanged on the portion size.

The Ugly:
I think this place is a nice place to try Cuban food if you were interested in trying it.   I think the food and experience was great but if you want some good authentic Cuban food than you may want to do a little more research and try something that doesn't have a commercialized feel and setup.

Yours Truly,
Mr. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly",2021

I had the stuffed flounder, collards & cheese grits. Flounder stuffing was rich (a bit less salt would've been perfect)& complemented the well seasoned fish.  Grits and greens were good.
Plates came w 2 hush puppies. Seemed like they had sugar in the mix so a little sweet.

It's packed most of the time what we saw, the 3 days we were visiting St. Augustine. If you ever catch yourself around go and try it! The gentleman at the front of the line to greet guest and control the flow into the restaurant was fantastic. Very personable and funny. He was kind and courteous. He set the stage and we knew we were in for a treat. Walking in is beautiful with the string of lights in the trees. We were sat upstairs where you can view the water. It was a beautiful view. Now the food, was out of this world. I had the shrimp and grits while my fiance had the shrimp and chicken creole. It blew us away how good it was.

We thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the experience both visually and gastronomically. The outdoor deck is completely covered and offers panoramic views of the bay. Even on a warm day, the Gulf breeze was comfortably sufficient to keep the temperature pleasant. Our waiter was congenial and every one of his recommendations was spot on. The grouper, wolf fish, and salmon we had was excellent and the side dishes of red potatoes, grits, and coleslaw were as generous as they were tasty. The ambiance, great food, and spectacular desserts provided a wonderful milieu for us to catch up with old friends. I must add that their prices are quite reasonable especially considering we dined on fresh seafood. The only caveat I would offer is parking close to the restaurant can be challenging, but there is a shuttle that regularly makes the rounds from beachfront parking to all the shops and restaurants on Bridge Street.",2021
